\section{Motivation}

Modern computer ssytems are vulnerable to so called ``soft errors''.
A ``soft error'' is a transient (not persistent) error.
Meaning it does not permanenty modify, and potentially disable, the system.
However these errors lead to unexpected behaviour in the system, usually some sort of program crash.
While this might be less of a concern to the average user it is a problem in highly dependable and/or long running systems as well as computers in environments which are particularly error prone such as environment of high static electricity.

A large number of these errors are corrected using (mostly hardware) ECC.
However this ECC ususally only covers one and two bit errors and more elaborate checks can become costly in hardware.

The idea here therefore is that we use a software protection mechanism to only protect particularly sensitive data.
in this case the data used by the operating system kernel.

\subsection{Prior work}

Similar work done by Shirvani et al. and Samurai previously also use software mechanisms.
These however involve direct use by the programmer and expose rather complex API's, an aspect which makes this error prone.

Another way of correcting random runtime errors is to execute two copies of the smae program and comparing results.
However this cannot be done for the operating system.

\section{Approach}

The general idea is to separate the error correction itself from the program code using aspect-oriented programming.
This relieves the program developer from the responsibility of ensuring correct use of the error protection mechanisms of the protected data structures.

\subsection{Aspect oriented programming and GOP}

Aspect oriented programming is like compile time reflection.
It is a model for metaprogramming which allows a programmatic way of defining changes to the program code which are applied during compilation.

The Generoc Object Protection (GOP) injects a target class with an additional field containing a hamming code.
The code is a parity for all pieces of state in the class (aka the members).
